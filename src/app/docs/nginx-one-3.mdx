1. Add NGINX Instance to a Config Sync Group
1. Know where logs are located

## NGINX One Console

### What is NGINX One?

NGINX One is an all-in-one platform that integrates the best of NGINX’s offerings into a unified package that includes a
cloud-based dashboard and access to F5 Distributed Cloud. Customers get advanced load balancing, web and application
server capabilities, API gateway functionalities, and security features. The goal of NGINX One is to provide
unparalleled performance, security, and scalability for modern applications, whether they are deployed in the cloud,
on-premises, or in hybrid environments.

### NGINX One Console

NGINX One Console gives all NGINX users access to a SaaS experience for managing NGINX instances as part of the F5
Distributed Cloud. It gives NGINX users unrivaled visibility, delivery and optimization capabilities combined with the
speed and flexibility of the F5 Distributed Cloud Platform.

The NGINX One Console is valuable because it simplifies the complexities of modern application delivery by integrating
multiple functionalities into a single platform. This reduces the need for disparate tools, lowers operational overhead
and costs, and ensures robust security for your applications. Additionally, its comprehensive feature set—including
advanced load balancing, enhanced security, and performance optimization—provides customers with a reliable, scalable,
and secure solution for managing their applications.

You will be able to accelerate application delivery and time-to-value like never before with flexible pricing and SaaS

NGINX One Console is a a service provided in F5 Distributed Cloud.

The NGINX Instances are located in the customers environment. These instances will communicate to NGINX One Console
using the following protocol and ports shown in the table below.

| Type     | Value |
| -------- | ----- |
| Port     | 443   |
| Protocol | gRPC  |

There are a total of 2 gRPC connections.
