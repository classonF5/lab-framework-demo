## Config Sync Groups

Config Sync Groups allow us to group multiple NGINX instances and leverage an identical configuration across all instances. This feature is extremely helpful in ephemeral environments, such as Docker and Kubernetes, as the NGINX instance can pull its configuration versus needing to rebuild the NGINX container every time the configuration changes. This section will go through using this feature.

### Creating a Config Sync Group

1. Go to the NGINX One Console.

1. From the left menu in the *Manage* section, click on *Config Sync Groups*.

1. Click on *Add Config Sync Group*.

    ![Add Config Sync Group](media/lab5-1.png)

1. On the right, enter your unique lab deployment name, **<GetVariable name="petname" />**, then select *Create* on the bottom.

    ![Create New Config Sync Group](media/lab5-2.png)

1. Your unique Config Sync Group **<GetVariable name="petname" />** should be in the list.

    ![New Config Sync Group](media/lab5-3.png)

You can now explore your Config Sync Group by selecting **<GetVariable name="petname" />**.
When you select it, there are two tabs named *Details* and *Configuration*.

On the *Details* tab, there are two views: *Details* represents additional details of this group and *Instances* represents the NGINX instances that are in this group.

On the *Configuration* tab, there is a view that defines the NGINX configurations to use for all NGINX instances in this Config Sync Group.

Notice the configuration is empty when you first create a Config Sync Group. There are two ways to handle the initial configuration.

**Option 1:** Auto-generate the Config Sync Group's configuration by adding the first NGINX instance. The existing config from the NGINX instance will be used as the config for your Config Sync Group.

**Option 2:** Manually define the NGINX configurations before adding any NGINX instances using the UI text editor.


#### Adding new NGINX instances to config sync group

We will now proceed with populating our Config Sync Group with two NGINX Plus instances. We will be using the existing configuration from this first NGINX instance as the Config Sync Group's configuration. Let's start by adding an new NGINX Plus instance.

You can do it by taking the following actions from the NGINX One console: select *Add Instance to Config Sync Group* ->
select *Register a new instance with NGINX One then add to config sync group* ->
select *Next* ->
select *Use existing Key* -> provide *Data Plane Key*
select *Docker Container* tab.

We have two ways of adding instances to our sync group:
1. If the instance is NOT already registered with NGINX One, we will need to run a series of setup commands to register and add the instance to the config sync group.
1. If the instance is already registered with NGINX One and has a running NGINX Agent, manually updating the agent's config will automatically add the instance to the sync group.

When adding an NGINX Plus docker container, the instructions on the screen tell you how to:
    - Login to the NGINX private registry
    - Pull an NGINX Plus instance from the NGINX private registry
    - Run the container with the required NGINX One Console connection details

But for this lab, we have automated the first two steps of this process for you.

1. SSH into the **Lab Framework** component and run the following command to deploy a new NGINX Plus Container. Make sure you use your data plane key and the name of your config sync group where indicated:
    ```bash
    sudo docker run \
    --env=NMS_SERVER_GRPCPORT=443 \
    --env=NMS_SERVER_HOST=agent.connect.nginx.com \
    --env=NMS_SERVER_TOKEN="[YOUR DATA PLANE KEY]" \
    --env=NGINX_AGENT_INSTANCE_GROUP=[YOUR CONFIG SYNC GROUP] \
    --env=NMS_TLS_ENABLE=true \
    --restart=always \
    --runtime=runc \
    -d private-registry.nginx.com/nginx-plus/agent:debian
    ```
    Once the installation has completed, the NGINX Plus container will appear as an instance managed by your config sync group. If it doesn't immediately appear in the list, try clicking the refresh button.

1. Now SSH into your **NGINX Plus** component and use the following command to install and run the NGINX Agent. Make sure to use your dataplane key where indicated.

    ```bash
    curl https://agent.connect.nginx.com/nginx-agent/install | DATA_PLANE_KEY="[YOUR DATA PLANE KEY]" sh -s -- -y -c ace-kite
    ```
    Once the installation has completed, the NGINX Instance will appear as an instance managed by your config sync group. If it doesn't immediately appear in the list, try clicking the refresh button.




#### (Optional) Add an already registered instance to the config sync group

This method assumes your target NGINX instance is already registered in the NGINX One console, and therefore has a running NGINX agent associated with the console. In order to add this instance to our config sync group, we need to manually update the agent's configuration with our config sync group's information. Follow these steps to modify the agent's config and add the instance to the config sync group:

1. SSH into the NGINX instance either directly or via the jumphost.

1. Navigate to the agent's config file in the **/var/lib/nginx-agent/** directory, then open the **agent-dynamic.conf** file in a text editor of your choice.

1. Add the following code snippet to the bottom of the **agent-dynamic.conf** file and save the config file. As before, make sure to use your lab deployment name for the instance group: **<GetVariable name="petname" />**.

    ```nginx
    instance_group: [YOUR CONFIG SYNC GROUP NAME GOES HERE]
    ```
    The agent-dynamic.conf file should look similar to the example below:
    ```nginx
    # agent-dynamic.conf
    #
    # Dynamic configuration file for NGINX Agent.
    #
    # The purpose of this file is to track NGINX Agent configuration
    # values that can be dynamically changed via the API and the NGINX Agent install script.
    # You may edit this file, but API calls that modify the tags on this system will
    # overwrite the tag values in this file.
    #
    # The NGINX Agent configuration values that API calls can modify are as follows:
    #    - tags
    #
    # The NGINX Agent configuration value(s) that the NGINX Agent install script can modify are as follows:
    #    - instance_group
    instance_group: [YOUR CONFIG SYNC GROUP NAME GOES HERE]
    ```

1. Restart the NGINX Agent using the following command:

    ```bash
    sudo systemctl restart nginx-agent
    ```

This NGINX Instance will now appear as an instance managed by your config sync group. If it doesn't immediately appear in the list, try clicking the refresh button.

### Viewing Logs

Let's take a look under the hood at how a config sync group pushes configuration updates to all of its constituent NGINX instances simultaneously.
To do so, we'll examine the logs of the NGINX Agent (and others) in real-time for several instances simultaneously.

1. Open two separate SSH windows for both instances in your config sync group.
1. Use the following command to view the NGINX Agent logs in real time.
    ```bash
    sudo tail -f /var/log/nginx-agent/agent.log
    ```
1. Navigate to your sync group's configuration tab. Add the following section to the server block of the /etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf file:

    ```nginx
    location /test_publish {
        default_type text/html;
        return 200 '<html><body><h1>Published change made from NGINX One Config Sync Group</h1></body></html>';
    }
    ```
1. Save and publish these changes.
1. Pay attention to the agent.log feed on both instances as the configuration update is applied.

### Review

Great job! Through the use of Config Sync Groups, you have now accomplished a common Day-2 operation of scaling or upgrading your NGINX instances and NGINX One Console made this process extremely easy and fast!  You can also do this via the [NGINX One Console API](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx-one/api/api-reference-guide/) if you prefer to handle these steps through a pipeline.

    > :point_right: It is possible to mix NGINX Plus and NGINX OSS instances in a Config Sync Group. However, the NGINX configuration must be compatible for both the NGINX Plus and NGINX OSS instances. For example, you will not be able to publish configurations that are exclusive to NGINX Plus, like [JWT authentication](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx/admin-guide/security-controls/configuring-jwt-authentication/) to NGINX OSS. However, the ability to mix NGINX editions in a Config Sync Group can be very valuable in certain situations, such as when migrating from NGINX OSS to NGINX Plus.

## Lab Cleanup

Time to clean up the resources you created in this lab. As a safety precaution, the NGINX One console will not allow you to delete an instance that is online. We will first have to shut down the instances before deleting them from the NGINX One console.

1. Click **Stop** on all the Docker instances displayed below:
    ```
    Instructions to stop running instances
    ```
    
1. From the NGINX One console, in the left-hand menu in the *Manage* section, select *Instances*.

1. Wait until your **<GetVariable name="petname" />*** instances transition into the **Unavailable** state before proceeding. You may need to click the *Refresh* button at the top right of the instance list.

    ![Instance Unavailable](media/cleanup-3.png)

1. For each of your **<GetVariable name="petname" />*** instances, select the *Actions* "..." context menu, and select
    *Delete*.

    > :warning: **Warning:** Make sure you are deleting your own instances and not someone elseâ€™s.

    ![Deleting an instance](media/cleanup-4.png)

1. Confirm the deletion.

    ![Confirming the deletion](media/cleanup-5.png)

1. From the NGINX One console, in the left-hand menu in the *Manage* section, select *Config Sync Groups*.

1. Delete your **<GetVariable name="petname" />*** Config Sync Groups by selecting the *Actions* "..." context menu, then select *Delete* for each.

    ![Delete Config Sync Group](media/cleanup-8.png)

1. Confirm the deletion.

    ![Confirming the deletion](media/cleanup-9.png)

1. From the NGINX One console, in the left-hand menu in the *Manage* section, select *Data Plane Keys*.

1. Select the context menu for the Data Plane Key you created in lab 1, and select *Revoke*.

    > :warning: **Warning:** Make sure you are revoking your own key and not someone elseâ€™s.
